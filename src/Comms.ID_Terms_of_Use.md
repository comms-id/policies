Welcome to Comms.ID. These Terms of Use ("Terms") form a binding legal agreement between you ("you," "your") and Comms.ID Pty Ltd ("Comms.ID," "we," "us," "our"). This agreement governs your access to and use of the Comms.ID platform, including our applications (web, iOS, Android), services, and websites.

By creating a Comms.ID account or using our platform, you agree to be bound by these Terms and our privacy documents, including our **[Privacy Policy](/privacy)**, **[Identity Services Privacy Notice](/privacy-identity-services)**, and **[Identity Exchange Privacy Notice](/privacy-identity-exchange)**. Please read them carefully.

## **1. Your Comms.ID Account**

- **Eligibility:** To create an account, you must be at least 15 years of age and meet the identity verification requirements of our service.
- **A Single, Personal Account:** Your Comms.ID account is strictly for your own personal use. You may not create an account for another person, create more than one account for yourself, or allow any other person to use your account. Your account is non-transferable.
- **Accurate Information:** You agree to provide true, accurate, and complete information during the identity verification process and to keep your contact information up to date.

## **2. Your Security Responsibilities in a Password-Free System**

The Comms.ID platform is password-free. Your security depends on the combination of your biometrics and the security of your trusted device(s). You therefore have a critical role to play in protecting your account.

You agree to:

- Take all reasonable steps to secure your trusted device(s), for example, by using a strong device passcode, PIN, or on-device biometrics (fingerprint or face unlock).
- Protect your device(s) from loss, theft, or unauthorised use.
- Immediately notify us through our secure support channels if you lose your device or suspect it has been compromised.
- Never share your device with others in a way that would allow them to access your Comms.ID account.

You are responsible for all activities that occur through your Comms.ID account. We are not liable for any loss that results from your failure to secure your device.

## **3. Acceptable Use of the Platform**

You agree to use the Comms.ID platform only for its intended purpose and in compliance with all applicable laws. You must not:

- Use the service for any illegal, fraudulent, or malicious purpose.
- Impersonate any person or entity or misrepresent your identity or your authority to act on behalf of a business.
- Use the service to harass, abuse, or harm another person.
- Attempt to bypass, disable, or interfere with any of our security features.
- Decompile, reverse engineer, or otherwise attempt to derive the source code of our applications.

## **4. Interacting with Relying Parties**

Our platform facilitates your secure interaction with third-party websites and services ("Relying Parties"). When you consent to share your information with a Relying Party, you understand and agree that:

- Comms.ID acts as the Identity Exchange, managing the consent and information flow as described in our **[Identity Exchange Privacy Notice](/privacy-identity-exchange)**.
- We are not responsible for the business practices, security, or privacy policies of any Relying Party. Any dispute you have with a Relying Party must be resolved directly with them.
- Your relationship with a Relying Party is governed by their separate terms and conditions and privacy policies.

## **5. Termination**

- **Termination by You:** You may terminate this agreement at any time by closing your Comms.ID account through our applications.
- **Termination by Us:** We reserve the right to suspend or terminate your access to the platform, without notice, if you breach these Terms, engage in any prohibited activity, or if we are required to do so by law.

Please note that upon termination, some of your information must be retained to comply with our legal obligations, as described in our **[Identity Services Privacy Notice](/privacy-identity-services)**.

## **6. Disclaimers and Limitation of Liability**

The Comms.ID service is provided "as is" and "as available" without any warranties, express or implied. While we strive for the highest levels of security and availability, we do not guarantee that the service will be uninterrupted or error-free.

To the fullest extent permitted by law, Comms.ID will not be liable for any indirect, incidental, special, consequential, or punitive damages, or any loss of profits or revenues, whether incurred directly or indirectly, arising from your access to or use of our service, or from any unauthorised access to or use of our systems.

## **7. General Terms**

- **Governing Law:** These Terms are governed by the laws of **Queensland, Australia**, and you agree to submit to the exclusive jurisdiction of the courts of that territory.
- **Changes to These Terms:** We may modify these Terms from time to time. We will provide you with reasonable notice of any material changes. Your continued use of the platform after such changes constitutes your acceptance of the new Terms.

For questions about these Terms, please contact us using the secure communications channels listed in our **[Privacy Policy](/privacy)**.
