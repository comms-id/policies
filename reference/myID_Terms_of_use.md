## How these terms and conditions apply

The [myID Privacy Notice](https://www.myid.gov.au/security-and-privacy/myid-privacy-notice) explains how we manage the personal information we collect.

These terms of use are governed by and follow the laws for the time being in force in the Australian Capital Territory, Australia.

## myID system

The myID system includes each of the myID service, the myID credential and the myID software.

- will not be liable for any loss or damage (including special, indirect or consequential) arising from or in connection with any of those elements of the myID system or its availability, use or performance either directly or through a third-party provider.

To the extent that the ATO's liability for the myID system (or any part of it) cannot be excluded, it is limited to the resupply of the relevant goods or services, or the cost of such resupply, at the ATO's option, or otherwise limited to the minimum amount permitted by law.

## myID software

You can email us for information about our Software at [support@myid.gov.au](mailto:support@myid.gov.au).

## myID service

You can access and use your myID account through the myID service. While the ATO will use reasonable efforts to rectify any issues with the myID service that it is aware of:

- the ATO makes no guarantees that the myID service, and your access to it (and your myID account), will be continuously available, uninterrupted, and fault or error free
- your access to the myID service (and your myID account) is contingent on telecommunication services and other factors beyond the ATO’s control
- the ATO may suspend or terminate access to the myID service through some or all products or to some or all users at any time.

You should take appropriate and adequate precautions to ensure that the information obtained from the myID service is free of viruses or other contamination that may interfere with or damage your systems, devices or data.

## myID credential

Your myID credential is a digital certificate associated with your myID account and is returned by the myID service to the application storage on the device you use for your myID account.

You are responsible for all transactions and communications carried out using your myID credential, and for the security and use of your myID account, your myID credential and the device on which it is stored or device used to authenticate.

You must:

- not use your myID credential for any unlawful or improper purpose
- not use your myID credential for any purpose other than to establish, verify or authenticate your identity when accessing online services of participating agencies
- not disclose the passwords for your myID account or myID credential to any other person
- not store your myID credential in a certificate store to which any other person has access, or otherwise allow, grant, permit or enable any other person to use your myID credential
- close your myID browser sessions and lock or secure your computer or device when not in use or unattended
- not undertake any screen capture, sharing or like activities that might compromise the security of your myID account or myID credential

This can include if your identity documents have been disclosed without your consent or authorisation, for example as the result of a data breach incident or theft, or there is a device or record you don’t recognise under [My devices](https://www.myid.gov.au/help/managing-your-myid#my-devices-your-myid-device-set-up-history) in your myID app.

## General

myID will collect, use, store and share your personal and sensitive information as detailed in the [myID Privacy Notice](https://www.myid.gov.au/security-and-privacy/myid-privacy-notice). The ATO will disclose your personal and sensitive information or myID credentials to third parties if you have provided your express consent to do so, or if authorised or required by law. We may use or disclose your information to analyse, prevent, detect, manage and investigate fraudulent activity or for another purpose allowable under the _Digital ID Act 2024,_ Digital ID Rules and Digital ID Accreditation Rules.

You acknowledge that the ATO may suspend, cancel or revoke your myID credential when it is permitted or required as described in the CPS. If you no longer wish to use the myID system, you may uninstall the app from all devices. If you choose to uninstall myID, we will manage your personal information as required by the _Digital ID Act 2024_ and the _Archives Act 1983_.

Any disputes between you and any third-party provider, including another Accredited Participant of the Digital ID System, must be resolved between you and that party.

The ATO is not responsible for any fees charged by other Accredited Participants or third-party providers. You are responsible for ensuring the installation and use of the myID system does not cause you to exceed any data usage quotas or other limitations that may apply to your internet service, device or other third-party provider.

These terms of use constitute the entire agreement between you and the ATO as administrator of the myID System. They supersede all prior communications, representations, agreements or understanding about these terms.
