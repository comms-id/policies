# Digital ID Exchange privacy policy

When using your digital ID, you agree to Services Australia handling your personal information in the Digital ID Exchange. This privacy policy outlines how we do this.

We, Services Australia, as an accredited identity exchange provider, manage the exchange of digital ID details on behalf of the Australian Government. We facilitate the use of your digital ID so you can prove your identity to a range of government services online.

It's your choice to create and use a digital ID and which identity service provider you use. If you don't want to use a digital ID, you have other ways to prove your identity or access government services. You should contact the service for more information.

This privacy policy outlines how we collect, use and disclose your personal information when you use your digital ID. The privacy and security of your personal information is important to us, and we protect it by law.

## Purposes of collection

We collect, use and share your personal information to facilitate the use and sharing of your digital ID and the information associated with it.

We may use and disclose your personal information for another purpose, if you consent or where it's required or authorised by law. For example, we can use or disclose your personal information to detect, manage and investigate Digital ID fraud incidents or cyber security incidents within the Australian Government Digital ID System (AGDIS).

## What we collect and share and why

When you access a service with your digital ID, they'll tell us what information they need to verify your identity.

We'll then ask your identity service provider for that information, and with your consent, share the details with the service. The service then handles your personal information in line with its own privacy policy.

Sometimes your identity service provider may need more information about you to verify your identity. If this happens, they'll tell us what additional information they need. We may also collect information from other agencies, called attribute service providers. They can verify certain information about you. An identity service provider, or the government service you wish to access, may need this information.

The types of information we may collect and share includes your:

- full name
- date of birth
- email address
- phone numbers
- business details such as ABN
- authorisation to access services on behalf of a business
- identity details from documents used to verify your identity
- myGov link between myGov and a linked service.

Services Australia, in its role as the operating service provider of the Digital ID Exchange, will also collect and share technical information about you to enable you to access services. This technical information does not comprise personal information and we won't link this information with any of your personal information.

Some government services require a stronger digital ID and you'll need to give more identity details or biometric face verification. We'll only collect and share the information the service needs to know about you.

To protect your privacy, we collect and share your information using secure authentication protocols. We also ensure that:

- your identity service provider can't see what services you're accessing
- the service you're accessing can't see your identity documents held by your identity service provider.

We also collect transactional data, such as the date and time of your session. This data helps us understand your use of your digital ID.

We will collect, use and disclose your personal information in instances where there is no end user involvement.

## Your consent

We need your consent before we share any of your personal information for a particular transaction.

It's your choice to give consent. We won't release your personal information unless you agree, or it's authorised or required by law. If we get an information request from another service, we'll need your consent first before sharing your information.

If you don't consent, you won't be able to use your digital ID for that service. You'll need to prove your identity another way so you can access that service.

When you give consent to share your details with a service, you can also tell us to remember your consent. We'll remember your consent and share your details the next time you need to prove your identity to that service.

Remembering consent is optional and you can change your mind at any time. If you don't want us to remember your consent, we'll ask for your consent every time you need to prove your identity to that service.

We can use and disclose your personal information for another purpose if you consent or where it's required or authorised by law. An example of this is using or disclosing your personal information to detect, manage and investigate Digital ID fraud incidents.

## Transactional information

Transactional information is technical data about how you use your digital ID.

Some examples of the transactional data we collect includes:

- a Session ID that we automatically generate when you want to use your digital ID
- the date and time of the transaction
- whether the transaction was successful
- the service that needs to verify your identity
- who you've consented to share your information with.

We'll collect and link this transactional information to help us identify and verify your transaction. This information is de-identified and will be encrypted. We won't link this information with any of your personal information.

We'll use and share this information with the service, your identity service provider or attribute service providers for the following purposes:

- auditing
- to comply with system operation requirements
- where required or authorised by law.

If a service you're accessing asks for another service's transactional information about you, we'll share that information if you consent.

We'll also share this information with:

- the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission (ACCC), as the Digital ID Regulator, and
- the Chief Executive Centrelink, as the System Administrator for the Australian Government Digital ID System.

This includes sharing tools we've used to analyse transactional data. The System Administrator uses data to:

- track outages
- view how people use their digital ID
- manage complaints
- investigate suspected Digital ID fraud incidents.

## How we store your personal information

Your personal information is encrypted and stored in our secure servers. After 2 hours, we discard the dynamic encryption key for your personal information.

We may store de-identified transactional information about you. We'll share your information only with the service you're accessing.

## Overseas disclosure

We won't store or disclose your personal or transactional information overseas. We keep all of your information in secure servers in Australia.

## How to access and correct information about you

You can view your transaction history and change your consent preferences at any time. However, you can't change any de-identified transactional information we collect and store about your use of your digital ID.

We don't retain your personal information for more than 2 hours. To access or correct your personal information, contact your identity service provider, services you've accessed or attribute service provider.

You have the right to request documents held by government agencies under the _Freedom of Information Act 1982 (Cth)_.

## If you have a concern or want to make a complaint

You can contact your identity service provider or relevant service to ask or complain about how they handle your personal information.
