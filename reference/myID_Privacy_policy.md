The purpose of this privacy policy is to explain how the Australian Taxation Office (ATO) handles your personal and sensitive information to operate the myID system, according to the Australian Privacy Principles in the _Privacy Act 1988_ (Privacy Act), the _Digital ID Act 2024_ and Digital ID Accreditation Rules 2024.

## About this privacy policy

myID (previously known as myGovID) is the Australian Government’s Digital ID Service Provider. The ATO delivers and administers the myID system as a secure digital environment for individuals to establish and verify their identity for authenticated access to participating online services.

The ATO complies with the requirements of the [Privacy ActExternal Link](https://www.legislation.gov.au/Series/C2004A03712), which incorporates both the:

- [Australian Privacy Principles (APPS)External Link](https://www.oaic.gov.au/privacy/australian-privacy-principles)
- [Australian Government Agencies Privacy Code (APP Agency Code)External Link](https://www.legislation.gov.au/F2017L01396/latest/text).

The myID service is accredited under section 15 of the [_Digital ID Act 2024_ External Link](https://www.legislation.gov.au/C2024A00025/asmade/text) for the information it manages when you use the myID system.

The use of the Document Verification Service (DVS) and the Face Verification Service (FVS) is subject to the [_Identity Verification Services Act 2023_ External Link](https://www.idmatch.gov.au/#:~:text=The%20Identity%20Verification%20Services%20Act%202023%20%28Cth%29%20was,Document%20Verification%20Service%20and%20the%20Face%20Verification%20Service.) (IVS Act).

You can find more information about privacy rights and responsibilities at the [Office of the Australian Information CommissionerExternal Link](https://www.oaic.gov.au/privacy/the-privacy-act/rights-and-responsibilities/).

This privacy policy deals with:

- our collection, storage, access to, use and disclosure of personal and sensitive information
- your rights to access and correct information we hold about you
- how you can make a complaint if you're concerned that
  - your privacy has been interfered with
  - we have breached an APP or APP Code.

We review this privacy policy regularly and will update it with relevant changes to keep you informed.

## How we collect personal information

We collect personal information (in accordance with APP 3 – _Collection of solicited personal information_):

- directly from you
- indirectly from you
- from third parties.

This information is collected for the purpose of:

- providing myID Digital ID services to you
- monitoring and improving the security and performance of the myID system.

### Directly from you

We will collect personal information directly from you when you use the myID system to:

- register and create an account for your myID
- increase the identity strength associated with your myID account
- update your personal information on your myID account.

If you don't provide your express consent to share your personal information, you won't be able to verify your identity to create a myID account.

If you can't create a myID account, alternative options may be available from the agency or service you are attempting to access.

### Indirectly from you

We collect information about your device and system interactions:

- when you access the myID service to manage your account or update your details
- to monitor myID application use and system performance
- when we investigate and verify the operation of the myID service, app and system.

### From third parties

We collect your personal information from government authorities to verify and validate the identity documents you provide to create your myID account, authenticate or increase your identity strength level.

For example, we will verify:

- Australian passports and travel documents with the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade
- drivers licences with the state or territory roads and traffic authority that issued the document
- Medicare cards with Services Australia.

## How we hold personal information

We protect your personal information held for the myID system against:

- loss, interference or misuse
- unauthorised access, modification or disclosure.

We use physical and technological controls to ensure that your personal information is only accessed by staff who need it.

We apply industry-best security methods to protect the personal information we hold, including:

- information technology and physical security audits
- penetration testing
- industry best practice risk management
- system security technologies.

We store your personal information collected for the purpose of myID separately from other records we hold. We hold it securely in Australia.

We will retain records of information associated with your myID while your registration remains active.

The personal information we collect about you will, in almost all cases, be treated as a Commonwealth record. We are bound by the _Archives Act 1983_ to retain Commonwealth records until we can lawfully dispose of them.

## Information we collect, hold and use

### Personal information

We collect personal information about you for the purpose of administration of the myID system.

Personal information is information that identifies you or is reasonably capable of identifying you.

The types of personal information collected by myID includes your:

- name
- date of birth
- address
- contact details, including email address and phone number
- details contained in Australian Government issued identity documents, such as
  - type of document
  - document issuer
  - document numbers
  - effective dates
  - photographic images of you
  - signatures
- [biometric images](https://www.myid.gov.au/security-and-privacy/myid-privacy-policy#biometric) of your face.

Personal information may also include information about the myID service, including:

- information on the method of access
- date and time your identity was verified.

When we have validated your identity documents, we will keep a record of the:

- document type used
- information that was verified
- express consent you provide
- document verification outcome.

When we collect personal and sensitive information as part of operating myID, it will be managed and destroyed in accordance with the law.

We collect personal information about your myID system use to:

- verify your identity
- compile statistics and reports to enhance our systems and services
- identify and respond to issues that indicate authentication integrity risks
- analyse, prevent, detect, manage and investigate fraudulent activity that may lead to criminal prosecution.

Personal information collected about your myID system use that will be logged also includes:

- information about your device and browser, such as your operating system and user session
- your internet protocol number (IP address)
- date and time of your use of the authentication service
- successful and unsuccessful attempts at authenticating.

We may disclose this information with other [Digital ID SystemExternal Link](https://www.digitalidsystem.gov.au/system-partners) participants, if we are authorised or required to by law.

### Biometric verification or identification

Verifying your photo is optional. It can help protect your identity and, when used to set up a Strong myID, allows you to access more services online.

We use the Face Verification Service to electronically compare your personal information and facial image against a specific government record to verify your identity.

For example, to verify your identity in the myID app using your Australian passport, we electronically compare the facial image and personal information from the Australian passport you provided with your passport records held by the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade.

The Face Verification Service can measure the biometric information for your facial image by using measurements or calculations about your physical appearance.

To verify your photo, you need to take a photo of yourself (a selfie) in the myID app. The technology scans your face while taking the photo. This one-off process checks that you’re:

- a real person – by checking for impersonation attempts, such as wearing a mask
- the right person – by comparing your image to the photograph on your passport
- verifying in real-time – by checking that you’re present and taking the photo, and not (for example) someone trying to scan a video.

We will only collect biometric information with your express consent.

If you decline to provide your express consent to verify your facial image, you can continue to set up your myID account to a Standard identity strength but will not be able to create a Strong identity strength myID account.

myID’s core function is to provide a high level of individual identity assurance. To fulfil and continuously improve this function, in specific circumstances where the real person check has failed, a biometric image may be viewable by a contracted third-party in the United Kingdom.

myID maintains effective control of the biometric image and this use conforms with:

- [_Digital ID Act 2024_ External Link](https://www.legislation.gov.au/C2024A00025/latest)
- [OAIC Australian Privacy Principles GuidelinesExternal Link](https://www.oaic.gov.au/privacy/australian-privacy-principles/australian-privacy-principles-guidelines)

Biometric images and photographs used by third-party providers as part of the verification process are destroyed within 14 days. For more information about the operation and management of the Face Verification Service and Document Verification Service, see [Access our services \| IDMatchExternal Link](https://www.idmatch.gov.au/access-our-services).

If you use your fingerprint or facial image as a secure login method on your device, this biometric function is restricted to the device itself that uses that technology to access your apps and personal information stored on your device. We do not collect or store your fingerprints or facial images used to access your device during myID registration or authentication processes.

### De-identified information

We may de-identify your personal information to compile reports and analyse statistical data related to using the myID system. We will use this data to understand use across the community and to enhance the myID service, but no individual will be reasonably identifiable.

## Information we use and disclose

We use and disclose your personal information in accordance with _APP 6 – Use or disclosure of personal information_.

We will use and disclose your personal information for the purpose of verifying, validating or authenticating your identity and to ensure the operational function of the myID service.

This may include disclosures of your personal information to other Digital ID System participants such as:

- the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission (ACCC), in its role as the Digital ID Regulator for the Australian Government Digital ID System (AGDIS)
- the Office of the Australian Information Commissioner (OAIC), in its role as the Privacy Regulator for the AGDIS
- Services Australia, in its capacity as the System Administrator of the AGDIS
- Treasury, in its capacity as the Data Standards Body for the AGDIS.

We won't disclose your personal information without you providing your express consent to:

- third parties, including the document issuer
- the identity exchange
- the online services you attempt to access.

When you do [provide your express consent](https://www.myid.gov.au/help/verifying-your-id#providing-your-express-consent), the information is disclosed for the purposes of:

- verifying your identity documents
- authenticating your identity
- confirming the outcome of any authentication attempts.

Your personal information will be stored securely in Australia.

If you don't consent to provide or share your personal information, you will be unable to create a myID account or achieve the necessary identity strength required to access some services.

If you won't or can't verify your identity by creating a myID account, alternative options may be available from the agency or service you are attempting to access.

We may share personal information to our contracted service providers, such as our telecommunications and cloud service partners, to enable us to provide myID services.

We won't use or disclose personal information:

- to overseas recipients
- for the purpose of direct marketing.

We won't use or disclose your personal information for any other purpose unless either:

- you have provided express consent
- we are required or authorised to do so under an Australian law (such as to an enforcement body for enforcement related activities) or a court or tribunal order.

You can delete or uninstall the myID app from your device, however this won't delete your myID account. If you no longer consent to your Digital ID being used, you can contact the [myID support line](https://www.myid.gov.au/contactus) to discuss other options available.

You can withdraw your express consent by [deleting your myID](https://www.myid.gov.au/help/managing-your-myid#deleting-your-myid) at any time; however, some personal information may be retained in accordance with the _Digital ID Act 2024_ and the _Archives Act 1983._ By withdrawing your express consent, you will no longer be able to use myID to access participating online services.
