# Digital ID Exchange privacy notice

We, Services Australia, are an accredited identity exchange provider as part of the Australian Government Digital ID System.

## Verify your identity online and use a digital ID

You need to create a [digital ID](https://auth.identity.gov.au/help) with an identity service provider using your personal information. Your identity service provider will use this information to verify your identity and create your digital ID.

They'll share your verified identity details with us when you access our services with your digital ID. The types of information include your name, date of birth, mobile phone number and email address.

With your consent, we'll then share your identity details with the service that needs to verify your identity. We'll only share the information the service needs.

You can withdraw your ongoing consent for any service at any time. To manage your consent, go to your home page and select manage consent from the menu.

If you withdraw your ongoing consent for a service, we won't be able to share your digital ID details with that service. This means you won't be able to use your digital ID to access that service.

Your identity service provider and the service you're accessing will handle your information in line with their own privacy policies.

It's your choice to create and use a digital ID and which identity service provider you use. If you don't want to use a digital ID, you have other ways to prove your identity or access government services. You should contact the service for more information.

We may use your personal information with automated decision-making systems and tools to help us provide you with the services, and undertake the activities, described in this privacy notice. If we use these systems and tools, we will comply with all applicable laws when doing so. Our use of these systems and tools does not affect any rights you may have to request a review of a decision we make.

## Acting on behalf of a business

If you're acting on behalf of a business, you'll need to verify your identity online with the Relationship Authorisation Manager (RAM). The RAM will share your permissions and identity details with us. With your consent, we'll then share your identity details and permissions with the service requesting it. For more information go to the [RAM websiteopens in a new tab](https://info.authorisationmanager.gov.au/).

## Security of your details

We take security very seriously. We don't store your identity details. We only store information about your use of your digital ID.

We encrypt and store this information on secure servers in Australia. We don't store or disclose any of your information overseas.

We may use or disclose this information where the law requires or allows. This includes using or disclosing personal information to detect, manage and investigate Digital ID fraud incidents.

Read the [Digital ID Exchange privacy policy](https://auth.identity.gov.au/policy) for more information about how we store, collect or disclose your personal information.

It also contains information about:

- how we manage your personal information
