## How we collect information

We collect your personal information through a variety of channels. This includes paper forms or notices, search warrants, online portals, mobile applications, correspondence, face to face or over the telephone.

We may also collect your personal information from third parties including other government agencies:

- as a result of a tip-off
- when undertaking data matching
- through administering legislation
- in the lodgement of a complaint
- in the context of enforcement activities
- when administering whole-of-government online services.

When your personal information is collected from a third party, we take steps to inform you. This may occur through this Privacy Policy, application forms, notices or discussions with our staff.

### Social networking services

We use social networking services such as Facebook, X, YouTube, Instagram and Yammer to talk with the public and our staff. When you talk with us using these services we may collect your personal information to communicate with you and the public.

The social networking service will also handle your personal information for its own purposes. These services have their own privacy policies. You can access the privacy policies for these services on their websites.

### Data exchanges

We exchange data with other agencies through technical pathways such as the digital gateway. We do this under relevant legislation to collect accurate and up-to-date information about customers and to enable other agencies to conduct data matching activities. We can also assist other agencies to exchange data using the same pathways. Read about [Centrelink program data matching activities](https://www.servicesaustralia.gov.au/centrelink-data-matching-activities?context=22).

### Data matching

Data matching is where we compare income information collected from you with information held by other organisations, such as the Australian Taxation Office (ATO). We do this to help deliver the payments and services you’re eligible for.

We prepare Programme Protocols for our data matching programs, in accordance with guidelines issued by the Office of the Australian Information Commissioner (OAIC). Read about [Centrelink program data matching activities](https://www.servicesaustralia.gov.au/centrelink-data-matching-activities?context=22).

### CCTV

We collect closed circuit television (CCTV) images of you when you attend our service centres, and we may share those images with other service centres in certain circumstances. We do this to help deliver services safely and securely.

Read our [privacy notice about CCTV](https://www.servicesaustralia.gov.au/cctv-privacy-notice?context=22).

## Why we collect information

We collect personal information about you where it is reasonably necessary for, or directly related to, one or more of our functions or activities.

### To deliver payments and services

We may collect your personal information when it is reasonably necessary for delivering payments or services. For example, we may collect your personal information to:

- confirm your identity
- communicate with you, including by SMS or email
- provide advice about available support
- ensure correct payments are made
- verify data provided in relation to claims and reviews with third parties
- investigate fraud, including internal fraud and the assessment of payment eligibility
- manage complaints and feedback
- participate in merits and judicial review matters
- manage and respond to requests for information
- administer and provide online services, including myGov
- act as an accredited entity, specifically the Identity Exchange Provider and as an attribute service provider within the Australian Government Digital ID system
- act as an accredited participant, operating the Digital Identity exchange within the Australian Government Digital ID system.

The reasons we collect your personal information will depend on the payments and services you access or are seeking. Read why we collect your personal information for:

- [Medicare and Health Programs](https://www.servicesaustralia.gov.au/sites/default/files/privacy-policy-medicare-and-health-program-related-purposes.docx "Word document")
- [Aged Care](https://www.servicesaustralia.gov.au/sites/default/files/2024-10/privacy-policy-aged-care-assessment-process.docx "Word document")
- [Centrelink](https://www.servicesaustralia.gov.au/sites/default/files/2025-06/privacy-centrelink-purposes-2507.docx "Word document")
- [Child Support](https://www.servicesaustralia.gov.au/sites/default/files/child-support-purposes-2020.docx "Word document")
- [National Redress Scheme](https://www.servicesaustralia.gov.au/sites/default/files/redress-privacy-policy-2022.docx "Word document").

We may use your information with automated decision-making systems and tools to help us deliver payments and services to you. This helps us improve the efficiency and accuracy of the payments and services we provide to you. We will comply with all applicable laws when using these systems and tools. Our use of these systems and tools does not affect any rights you may have to request a review of a decision we make.

### To improve our services

We may use your personal information to conduct statistical analysis and research to improve service delivery. We’ll contact you or a trusted research company will on our behalf. Our contracts with each research company contain legal binding provisions to protect your privacy.

We only give contracted research companies the details they need to contact you when they need it for their research. Your information stays confidential and is:

- not used for any purpose except for the specific research activity
- not given to anyone else
- destroyed or returned to us when the research is over.

Read about [how we use research and surveys to improve our services](https://www.servicesaustralia.gov.au/using-research-and-surveys-to-improve-our-services).

### For employment and recruitment

We collect personal information to establish and maintain records for the employment and recruitment of staff. You can read about the information we collect for [employment purposes](https://www.servicesaustralia.gov.au/sites/default/files/2025-03/collection-of-personal-information-for-our-employment-purposes.docx "Word document").

### To work better across the agency

Your personal information may be shared across our Centrelink, Child Support and Medicare service areas if you have given your consent or the sharing of your information is authorised or required by law.

### To make dealing with government easier for you

We administer platforms such as myGov and the Digital ID Exchange to deliver more convenient, accessible and efficient services. In doing so, we work with other Australian Government agencies, state and territory agencies and third parties. Your personal information may be shared for the purposes of developing and administering these platforms if either:

- you have given your consent
- the sharing of your information is authorised or required by law.

We are approved to provide accredited services within the Australian Government Digital ID System as an identity exchange provider and an attribute service provider. We provide these services as:

- the Digital ID Exchange, which supports the connection of relying parties with accredited services
- myGov, which issues and manages the myGov linkID attribute.

There are strict rules that apply to us in providing these services. The Australian Government Digital ID system is legislated by the Digital ID Act. Under the Digital ID Act, accredited Digital ID service providers must conduct testing and assessments, including:

- assurance assessments for protective security, fraud and accessibility and useability
- systems testing
- privacy impact assessments
- cyber security and fraud risk assessments
- technical testing.

The Digital ID Act requirements that apply to myGov and the Digital ID Exchange are in addition to obligations imposed by other policies, legislation or regulations, or by any other means.

We manage your personal information in performing our role as an accredited identity exchange provider and attribute service provider within the Australian Government Digital ID System. To find out more about how the Digital ID Exchange does this, read the privacy information on the Digital ID Exchange website:

- [privacy notice](https://auth.identity.gov.au/static/privacy)
- [privacy policy](https://auth.identity.gov.au/static/policy).

To understand more about how myGov manages your personal information, read the [myGov privacy notice](https://my.gov.au/en/about/privacy-and-security/mygov-privacy-notice).

This privacy policy applies to myGov’s activities as an attribute service provider in the Australian Government Digital ID System.

### Only when required or authorised with third parties

We may disclose your information to Australian Government agencies, state and territory agencies and third parties, where required or authorised by law. The disclosure of your personal information will depend on the payments or services to which the information relates.

### To help our community in a time of emergency or disaster

In some circumstances, we may share information to support people who have been affected by a disaster or emergency. This could include sharing information with agencies and organisations as part of the emergency response or recovery effort. We may, for example, share information to help affected individuals to access financial or other assistance from charities, as well as from Australian government agencies.

Read [who we can share your personal information with](https://www.servicesaustralia.gov.au/sites/default/files/2024-06/disclosure-of-personal-information-20200225.docx "Word document").

### To provide you with a more personalised experience

We may use information about your online experience to help us improve our services.

We may need to share your personal information if we’re authorised or required by law to do so.

Read our privacy notice about [data analytics and service improvement](https://www.servicesaustralia.gov.au/data-analytics-and-service-improvement-privacy-notice?context=22).

### To train Australian Public Service Senior Executive Service officers

We provide training to Senior Executive Service (SES) officers across the Australian Public Service to give them a better understanding of the agency’s service delivery work.

This training teaches them about implementing government policies related to social welfare and health programs.

If you give your consent, SES officers may listen to and observe face-to-face and telephone interactions with you. During the training, we may use or disclose your personal information and the personal information of others, if relevant.

Participating SES officers will not record any personal information shared during the training.

Your participation is voluntary. You may decline to provide consent and there are no consequences for doing so.

## How we store personal information

We take reasonable steps to protect your personal information against misuse, interference and loss, and from unauthorised access, modification or disclosure. These steps include:

- storing paper records securely as per Australian government security guidelines
- only accessing personal information on a need-to-know basis and by authorised personnel
- monitoring system access which can only be accessed by authenticated credentials
- ensuring our buildings are secure
- regularly updating and auditing our storage and data security systems.

When no longer required, we destroy or archive personal information in a secure manner.

### Data hosted for other agencies

We gather and store personal information on behalf of other agencies including in our data lake storage repository.

We do this in a similar way to a cloud service provider. We keep the hosted data separate from our own data and protect it with strict access controls. This means we don’t have control over the hosted data.

Send requests or complaints about hosted data to the agency the personal information belongs to. If we get a request or complaint about hosted data, we’ll send it to the agency it belongs to.

### Secrecy

In addition, our staff are bound by secrecy provisions that apply to information we collect for social security, family assistance, health, child support and redress law. These secrecy provisions restrict the access, use and communication of protected information, including within the agency.

## How we share information outside Australia

We may disclose your personal information overseas, such as to a foreign government or agency, where:

- the disclosure is required or authorised by law, or
- international information sharing arrangements are in place.

This may be more likely if you, your partner or dependants, or the other party to your Child Support case, live or have lived overseas, or are travelling overseas.

Under international information sharing arrangements we can either:

- collect and disclose information about you where it is requested by an overseas authority
- request information about you from an overseas authority.

While these arrangements differ, overseas authorities may have agreed to only use information for the purposes of the arrangements, and in accordance with relevant privacy obligations.

Read about the countries which have international information sharing arrangements in place:

- [Reciprocal Health Care Agreement](https://www.servicesaustralia.gov.au/reciprocal-health-care-agreements)
- [Reciprocating Jurisdictions and Residency for Child Support](https://www.servicesaustralia.gov.au/reciprocating-jurisdictions-and-residency-for-child-support)
- [International Social Security Agreements](https://www.servicesaustralia.gov.au/which-countries-have-international-social-security-agreements-with-australia).

## How to access and correct information about you

You have the right to request:

- access to personal information that we hold about you
- that we correct personal information we hold about you, if you believe it is inaccurate or out of date.

If you ask, we must give you access to your personal information and take reasonable steps to correct it if it is incorrect, unless there is a law that allows or requires us not to.

We will notify you in writing and explain our reasons if we refuse to give you access to, or correct, your personal information.

You can access and correct most of your details online using [self service](https://www.servicesaustralia.gov.au/self-service).

If you can’t use self service, read how to:

- [access information](https://www.servicesaustralia.gov.au/access-to-information?context=22)
- [contact us](https://www.servicesaustralia.gov.au/contact-us).

### Updating information about you

To ensure you are only accessing payments and services you are eligible for it’s important to tell us if your [circumstances change](https://www.servicesaustralia.gov.au/change-circumstances-if-you-get-centrelink-payment).

You can do this yourself using [self service](https://www.servicesaustralia.gov.au/self-service).

## What we do with your Tax File Number (TFN)

We adhere to the Privacy (Tax File Number) Rule 2015 for the collection, storage, use, disclosure, security and disposal of TFN information.

### Specific purposes why we may request your TFN

We may request your TFN to:

- administer various payments, and
- comply with legislation referred to in section 8WA(1AA) of the _Taxation Administration Act 1953._

You do not have to give us your TFN. However, if you don’t provide it, or authorise us to access it from the Australian Taxation Office, there may be financial consequences.

If you give us your TFN, we will only use it where you consent, or where the use is authorised or required by law.

### Prohibitions and penalties for unauthorised collection and use of TFN information

Under the Privacy (Tax File Number) Rule 2015 and the _Taxation Administration Act 1953_ it is an offence if we either:

- require, request or collect TFN information for unauthorised purposes
- record, use or disclose TFN information unless permitted under taxation, personal assistance or superannuation law.

A breach of the Privacy (Tax File Number) Rule 2015 is considered an interference with privacy under the Privacy Act _._ Where a breach of privacy is very serious, the Australian Information Commissioner may seek a civil penalty under the Privacy Act.

A breach of the _Taxation Administration Act 1953_ may result in maximum penalty of a $21,000 fine (100 penalty units), 2 years imprisonment or both.

There may also be other penalties under taxation, superannuation or personal assistance laws.

If you think your TFN information has been mishandled, you can make a complaint with the [Office of the Australian Information Commissioner](https://www.oaic.gov.au/about-the-OAIC/contact-us) (OAIC). The OAIC is independent to us.

### Further details about the TFN rules

Read the [Privacy (Tax File Number) Rule 2015](https://www.legislation.gov.au/F2015L00249/latest/text) and the [_Taxation Administration Act 1953_](https://www.legislation.gov.au/C1953A00001/latest/text) on the federal register of legislation website.

The OAIC has made the following information available to you to protect your TFN information:
