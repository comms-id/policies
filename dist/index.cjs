  "markdown": "\nWelcome to Comms.ID. Our mission is to build a more trustworthy digital world by combating fraud and misinformation. We do this by providing a secure, high-assurance digital identity platform that replaces insecure, anonymous interactions with a verified and consent-driven ecosystem.\n\nYour privacy is not an afterthought; it is fundamental to our design and our mission. This Privacy Policy outlines our core privacy commitments and explains how we handle your personal information.\n\n**Our Legal Framework**\n\nThe Australian Government Digital ID System (AGDIS) is a voluntary accreditation scheme. While Comms.ID is on the journey to achieve formal accreditation, we have built our platform from the ground up to adopt and conform to all relevant aspects of this framework and its governing legislation. We are bound by and committed to upholding our responsibilities under the:\n\n- **_Privacy Act 1988_ (Cth);**\n- **_Digital ID Act 2024_ (Cth); and**\n- **_Anti-Money Laundering and Counter-Terrorism Financing Act 2006_ (Cth) (AML/CTF Act).**\n\nAt all times, we aim to meet and exceed the best practices and legal requirements of this framework.\n\n## **2. Our Roles Explained: An Interoperable System**\n\nComms.ID performs several distinct roles within the AGDIS framework. This separation of roles is a fundamental requirement of the system's design to enhance your privacy and security. It also ensures our services are interoperable, meaning in the future they can work with other accredited providers in the digital identity network.\n\nOur roles include:\n\n- **Identity Service Provider (ISP):** Verifying your identity against official documents to create your secure Digital ID.\n- **Attribute Service Provider (ASP):** Verifying specific claims about you, such as your authority to act for a business.\n- **Identity Exchange (IXP):** Acting as the secure, consent-driven \"switchboard\" that manages information flow between you and the services you access (\"Relying Parties\").\n\nYou can find detailed information on how we handle data in these specific roles in our dedicated notices:\n\n- [Identity Services Privacy Notice][privacy-identity-services]\n- [Identity Exchange Privacy Notice][privacy-identity-exchange]\n\n## **3. Our Legal Obligations and Data Minimisation**\n\nWe are subject to strict legal obligations that govern how we operate. The **AML/CTF Act**, in particular, requires both us and many of the Relying Parties that use our services (e.g., banks) to verify your identity to a high standard and keep records of those verifications. This may require us to collect specific information and retain verification records for a minimum of 7 years, even after you close your account. These are mandatory legal duties designed to prevent serious crime.\n\nAt the same time, we are deeply committed to **data minimisation**. We believe your data should not be duplicated unnecessarily across the internet. Our \"Access vs. Access and Duplicate\" consent model, which is explained in our [Identity Exchange Privacy Notice][privacy-identity-exchange], is designed specifically to limit the spread of your personal information, giving you greater control and security than traditional online services.\n\n## **4. Your Privacy Rights**\n\nYou are in control of your personal information. You have the right to:\n\n- **Access:** Review your personal information at any time through the Comms.ID mobile or web applications.\n- **Correction:** Request to have incorrect information corrected.\n- **Deletion:** Close your Comms.ID account at any time. Upon your request, we will delete your personal information, subject to any legal obligations to retain it (such as under the AML/CTF Act).\n- **Withdraw Consent:** View and revoke your consent for sharing information with a specific Relying Party at any time.\n\n## **5. Data Security and Storage**\n\nProtecting your information is our highest priority. We store all personal information on secure servers located within Australia and will not transfer your personal information overseas. We use industry-leading security measures, including end-to-end encryption, and undergo regular independent security assessments to ensure our systems are robust.\n\n## **6. Information for Minors**\n\nThe Comms.ID service is available to individuals aged 15 years and older. We do not knowingly collect personal information from individuals under the age of 15.\n\n## **7. How to Contact Us and Make a Complaint**\n\nTo protect you from fraud, **we will never use standard email, SMS, or unsecure phone calls for authentication or to request sensitive personal information.**\n\n**To get support from a real person at Comms.ID, please use our secure, end-to-end encrypted channels:**\n\n- Use the secure chat widget on our public website at **<https://comms.id/>**.\n- Use the in-app communication features (chat messages, voice or video calls) at **<https://auth.comms.id/>**, **<https://companion.comms.id/>**, or within our **iOS and Android apps**.\n\nIf you have a privacy concern or wish to make a complaint, please contact us first using these secure methods. If you are not satisfied with our response, you have the right to lodge a complaint with the **Office of the Australian Information Commissioner (OAIC)**.\n\n## **8. Governing Law**\n\nThis Privacy Policy and our handling of your personal information are governed by the laws of **Queensland, Australia.**\n\n[privacy-policy]: #\n[terms-of-use]: #\n[privacy-identity-services]: #\n[privacy-identity-exchange]: #\n[relying-party-agreement]: #\n",

  "markdown": "\n## **1. Purpose of This Notice**\n\nThis notice provides detailed information about how we handle your personal information when you create and manage your Comms.ID Digital ID. When we perform these functions, we are acting as an **Identity Service Provider (ISP)** and an **Attribute Service Provider (ASP)** in alignment with the Australian Government Digital ID System (AGDIS) framework.\n\nCreating a Comms.ID is a prerequisite for using our services. This process involves verifying your identity to a high level of assurance and requires your explicit consent for the collection and storage of identity documents and biometric information, which are necessary for our high-security model.\n\n## **2. Verifying Your Identity (Our Role as an ISP)**\n\nTo issue you a secure, reusable Digital ID, we must first verify you are who you say you are.\n\n- **What Information We Collect:** We will ask you to provide information from, and capture images of, your Australian government-issued identity documents. This includes:\n\n  - An image of the identity document itself.\n  - An image of you holding your identity document.\n\n- **How We Verify It:** We use the details from your document to perform a real-time check with the Australian Government's **Document Verification Service (DVS)**, confirming the details match the issuing agency's records.\n\n- **How and Why We Store Document Images:** To enable high-assurance features and comply with regulatory expectations, we securely store the images of your identity document. This is necessary to:\n  - Allow for offline or in-person verification (e.g., a venue checking your ID against your face).\n  - Meet the requirements for higher Identity Proofing Levels (such as IP4).\n  - Assist in high-priority fraud investigations.\n\n---\n\n## **3. Your Biometric Information: The Key to Your Security**\n\nOur platform is designed to be password-free. Your security is guaranteed by binding your verified identity to you as a person. This requires the use of your biometric information (your face) for both creating your Digital ID and for every subsequent authentication.\n\nThis section explains how we handle this sensitive information. **Your explicit consent to these practices is mandatory to create and use a Comms.ID account.**\n\n**What We Collect and Why**\n\nDuring setup and subsequent authentications, we will ask you to perform a facial scan using your device's camera. This process includes a \"liveness check\" to ensure you are a real person.\n\nFrom these scans, we create and securely store:\n\n1. A **biometric template**: A mathematical representation of your face used for automated matching.\n2. **A limited gallery of your authentication images and videos**: These are retained to provide a higher level of confidence and security for your account.\n\nStoring this information is mandatory because it is essential for our security model. It allows us to:\n\n- Effectively investigate fraud or transaction disputes (e.g., if you report an unauthorised event).\n- Securely verify your identity if you register a new, untrusted device.\n- Maintain an auditable, high-confidence record of authentications.\n\n**How We Use Your Biometric Information**\n\nYour biometric data is used exclusively for identity verification and authentication purposes. This is always a **one-to-one (1:1) match** to confirm your presence and identity. **We will never use your biometric information for one-to-many (1:N) searching or for any other purpose.**\n\n**Your Explicit Consent**\n\nBy creating an account and ticking the specific consent checkbox during registration, you provide your **express and informed consent** for Comms.ID to collect, use, and store your **biometric template, as well as the images and videos from your identity setup and subsequent authentications**, as described in this section.\n\n**Data Retention and Your Right to Withdraw Consent**\n\nYou have the right to withdraw your consent at any time. If you close your account or withdraw your consent:\n\n- Your **biometric template and all associated authentication images and videos** will be **immediately and permanently destroyed**.\n\nPlease note that withdrawing consent for biometric processing will result in the closure of your Comms.ID account, as it is essential for the security and operation of our service.\n\n---\n\n## **4. Verifying Your Attributes (Our Role as an ASP)**\n\n- **Beneficial Ownership:** Our service can verify your status as a beneficial owner or director of a company. We do this by checking your details against information held in official government sources, such as the Australian Business Register (ABR).\n- **Other Attributes:** We do not currently verify other attributes, such as professional qualifications, unless it is to conduct simplified verification of a regulated entity that is itself a Relying Party, as permitted by law.\n\n## **5. Record Keeping and Your Data**\n\nAs outlined in our [Privacy Policy][privacy-policy], we are subject to legal obligations, including the _Anti-Money Laundering and Counter-Terrorism Financing Act 2006_. This requires us to keep records of identity verification actions and the evidence used for that verification for a minimum period of 7 years. This retention requirement **applies to the images of the identity documents you provided** during setup.\n\nHowever, this legal retention requirement **does not apply to your biometric data**. As stated above, all biometric templates, authentication images, and videos are permanently destroyed upon account closure.\n\n[privacy-policy]: #\n[terms-of-use]: #\n[privacy-identity-services]: #\n[privacy-identity-exchange]: #\n[relying-party-agreement]: #\n",

  "markdown": "\nThis notice explains what happens when you use your Comms.ID to access a 3rd party (a \"Relying Party\") website, app, or service. In these moments, we are acting as an **Identity Exchange Provider (IXP)** in alignment with the Australian Government Digital ID System (AGDIS) framework.\n\nThink of our Identity Exchange as a secure digital switchboard. It doesn't permanently store your identity; it manages the secure flow of information between you, your Comms.ID, and the Relying Party you wish to interact with. Its entire function is built around your control and your consent, and a particular distiction of Comms.ID Identity Exchange vs other identity systems is the principle of data minimisation.\n\n## **2. Your Consent: \"Access\" or \"Access and Duplicate\" vs. \"Duplicate\"**\n\nWhen you use other digital identity systems with any other app or website they will request your consent to get your personal data, all of that data is all sent \"over the wire\". Usually they will say \"access\" but in fact in practice they _duplicate_ your data! Over a period of 1-3 years, if you use 12-36 apps or financial services or any other websites or services, there will be 12-36 copies of your personal information on these 3rd party sytems and databases. This puts your data outside of your control, increasing the likelihood of it being hacked or misused. The default for other systems is actually to \"Duplicate\" your data, and it increases the risks of compromise by more than 1000-3000%.\n\nComms.ID Identity Exchange is different, it is designed to minimise this data duplication. When a Relying Party (any other app or website) requests your personal information, the only data they get \"over the wire\" that can be duplicated is what is needed for personalisation of your user expereince inside their app. For example, your name and a profile picture. Everything else they need, including records for compliance reasons, can only be \"accessed\" in a secure dashboard we provide to them called the Companion App. This means that if any of the 12-36 apps or websites or servies you use are compromised, most of your idenity data will not be there. The default for apps and websites that you use with Comms.ID is \"Access\", \"Access and Duplicate\" is highly restricted. \"Duplicate\" is not even an option.\n\nWhen a website or app you use needs your personal information, Comms.ID Identity Exchange will clearly present to you on the consent screen:\n\n- **Access Only:** This is our preferred and default method. With this consent, your personal information is **not** sent to the Relying Party's systems. Instead, it remains securely within the Comms.ID ecosystem and is made available to them only through our secure **Companion App**. This allows them to verify information as needed and meet compliance without creating a copy of your data.\n\n- **Access and Duplicate:** In some cases, a Relying Party may require a copy of your data to function (for example, to display your name or profile picture in their user interface). With this consent, the specific information requested is securely sent to the Relying Party. While these Relying Parties are bound by the _Privacy Act_, this action does create a copy of your data outside of our direct control.\n\n**The Consent Process**\n\nThe consent screen will show you exactly what information a Relying Party is requesting and what type of access they require. You have one simple choice:\n\n- **Agree:** To accept the entire request as presented.\n- **Decline:** To decline the entire request. No information will be shared.\n\nIf you Agree, you can use the Relying Party's app like normal.\nIf you Decline, the Relying Party's app or service will not work.\n\n## **3. Breach or overreach on your data**\n\nKeep in mind, with Comms.ID the Relying Parties are contractually bound not to request more of your data than what is absolutely nessecary. Relying Parties are also bound by the Privacy Act only to request data from you they actually need to provide the service you want from them. We will enforce the rights of Data Minimisation afforded to you if a Relying Party breaches or overreaches with respect to Data Minimisation, we take the matter of protecting your privacy rights more seriously than other identity systems.\n\n## **4. Information We Handle (But Don’t Keep)**\n\nOur Identity Exchange is designed to be a temporary holder of your information. During a transaction, personal data passes through our systems. This information is encrypted during transfer and is **transient**. It is **not retained** by our Identity Exchange function once the transaction is complete. This is a core privacy protection that minimises the storage of your data in this part of our system.\n\n## **5. Transactional Information We Do Keep**\n\nTo ensure the security, integrity, and reliability of our platform, we do keep a record of the transaction itself. This **“transactional data”** is de-identified technical information and includes:\n\n- A unique, anonymous identifier for the transaction session.\n- The date and time of the transaction.\n- The outcome of the transaction (e.g., successful, declined by user).\n- Which Relying Party was involved.\n\nWe retain this de-identified data for auditing, security monitoring, and fraud investigation. This data is not linked to your personal identity in our Exchange logs.\n\n## **6. Managing Your Consent**\n\nYou are always in charge of who you share your information with. You can view and revoke any ongoing consents you have granted to Relying Parties at any time through the Comms.ID mobile or web applications. Revoking consent means that Relying Party can no longer use our service to verify your identity until you grant consent again.\n\nFor questions about these practices, please contact us using the secure channels listed in our **[Privacy Policy][privacy-policy]**.\n\n[privacy-policy]: #\n[terms-of-use]: #\n[privacy-identity-services]: #\n[privacy-identity-exchange]: #\n[relying-party-agreement]: #\n",

No information will be shared.\n\nIf you Agree, you can use the Relying Party's app like normal.\nIf you Decline, the Relying Party's app or service will not work.\n3. Breach or overreach on your data\nKeep in mind, with Comms.ID the Relying Parties are contractually bound not to request more of your data than what is absolutely nessecary. Relying Parties are also bound by the Privacy Act only to request data from you they actually need to provide the service you want from them. We will enforce the rights of Data Minimisation afforded to you if a Relying Party breaches or overreaches with respect to Data Minimisation, we take the matter of protecting your privacy rights more seriously than other identity systems.\n4. Information We Handle (But Don’t Keep)\nOur Identity Exchange is designed to be a temporary holder of your information. During a transaction, personal data passes through our systems. This information is encrypted during transfer and is transient. It is not retained by our Identity Exchange function once the transaction is complete. This is a core privacy protection that minimises the storage of your data in this part of our system.\n5. Transactional Information We Do Keep\nTo ensure the security, integrity, and reliability of our platform, we do keep a record of the transaction itself. This “transactional data” is de-identified technical information and includes:\n\nA unique, anonymous identifier for the transaction session.\nThe date and time of the transaction.\nThe outcome of the transaction (e.g., successful, declined by user).\nWhich Relying Party was involved.\n\nWe retain this de-identified data for auditing, security monitoring, and fraud investigation. This data is not linked to your personal identity in our Exchange logs.\n6. Managing Your Consent\nYou are always in charge of who you share your information with. You can view and revoke any ongoing consents you have granted to Relying Parties at any time through the Comms.ID mobile or web applications. Revoking consent means that Relying Party can no longer use our service to verify your identity until you grant consent again.\nFor questions about these practices, please contact us using the secure channels listed in our Privacy Policy.",

  "markdown": "\nThis Relying Party Agreement (\"Agreement\") is a binding legal contract between **Comms.ID Pty Ltd** (ACN: 686 963 904), a company incorporated in Queensland, Australia (\"Comms.ID,\" \"we,\" \"us,\" \"our\"), and the entity registering to use the Comms.ID platform as a Relying Party (\"Relying Party,\" \"you,\" \"your\").\n\nBy registering a client, integrating with our platform, or using the Comms.ID Services, you agree to be bound by the terms and conditions of this Agreement.\n\n## **1. The Comms.ID Ecosystem and Our Commitment**\n\nComms.ID provides a secure digital identity platform (\"Platform\" or \"Services\") designed to combat fraud and build digital trust. Our Platform operates in alignment with the Australian Government Digital ID System (AGDIS).\n\n1.1. **Voluntary Alignment with AGDIS:** AGDIS is a voluntary accreditation scheme. While Comms.ID is on the journey to achieve formal accreditation, we have built our Platform from the ground up to adopt and conform to all relevant aspects of the AGDIS framework, including the _Digital ID Act 2024_, associated Rules, Data Standards, and the _Privacy Act 1988_. We aim to meet and exceed the best practices and legal requirements of the AGDIS framework. Our commitment to these standards is unwavering regardless of our accreditation status.\n\n1.2. **Interoperability and Separation of Roles:** The AGDIS framework is designed for interoperability. This separation of roles (Identity Service Provider, Attribute Service Provider, Identity Exchange) is a fundamental requirement of the system's design to enhance privacy and security. While Comms.ID currently provides an integrated ecosystem, our architecture anticipates future interoperability with other accredited providers. This Agreement governs your use of our Platform within this framework.\n\n## **2. Registration and Onboarding**\n\n2.1. **Dynamic Client Registration (DCR):** You may register to use the Services through our automated DCR process. You warrant that all information provided during registration is true, accurate, and complete.\n\n2.2. **Vetting and Approval:** We reserve the right to vet any Relying Party. For certain high-risk scopes, such as `aml/ctf`, registration will result in a \"Pending Review\" status. We may require you to provide additional information, including evidence of your compliance with applicable laws (such as your Anti-Money Laundering and Counter-Terrorism Financing Program). We retain the absolute discretion to approve, reject, or revoke your access to any or all Services to protect the integrity of our Platform and its users.\n\n## **3. Your Obligations as a Relying Party**\n\n3.1. **Compliance with Laws:** You warrant that you will use the Services in full compliance with all applicable laws, including the _Privacy Act 1988_ and, where applicable, the _Anti-Money Laundering and Counter-Terrorism Financing Act 2006_ (AML/CTF Act).\n\n3.2. **Data Handling and User Consent:** You acknowledge and agree that:\n(a) The Comms.ID Platform is designed around end-user consent. You may only request personal information from a user that is reasonably necessary for your service.\n(b) You must respect the type of data access granted by the user (\"Access Only\" or \"Access and Duplicate\"). Where \"Access Only\" is granted, you agree not to attempt to scrape, copy, or otherwise store the user's personal information outside of the secure viewing environment provided by the Comms.ID Companion App.\n(c) You are solely responsible for how you handle, store, and secure any personal information that a user consents to duplicate to your systems, and you must do so in accordance with the _Privacy Act_.\n\n3.3. **Security:** You are responsible for securely managing your client credentials, API keys, and access to the Platform. You must notify us immediately of any suspected unauthorised access.\n\n3.4. **Fair Use Policy:** You agree to abide by our Fair Use Policy. We reserve the right to monitor usage and suspend or limit your access if your use is deemed fraudulent, malicious, or so excessive that it degrades the performance and availability of the Platform for other users.\n\n## **4. Fees and Payment (For Subscribed Services)**\n\n4.1. **Basic Service:** Access to our core identity verification services may be provided free of charge, at our discretion.\n\n4.2. **Subscribed Services:** Access to certain features and scopes (e.g., `aml/ctf` compliance solutions) requires a paid subscription (\"Subscribed Services\"). Fees for Subscribed Services will be based on your chosen subscription tier and are payable monthly in advance.\n\n4.3. **Payment Terms:** You agree to pay all applicable fees in a timely manner. We reserve the right to suspend access to Subscribed Services for non-payment. Fees are non-refundable except as required by law.\n\n## **5. Intellectual Property**\n\nWe grant you a limited, non-exclusive, non-transferable, revocable license to access and use our Platform and integrate with our APIs solely for the purpose of receiving the Services as permitted by this Agreement. We retain all right, title, and interest in and to the Comms.ID Platform.\n\n## **6. Confidentiality**\n\nYou may have access to confidential information relating to our Platform. You agree to keep such information confidential and not disclose it to any third party without our prior written consent, except as required by law.\n\n# **7. Disclaimer and Limitation of Liability**\n\n7.1. **Disclaimer:** Except as expressly stated in this Agreement, the Services are provided \"as is\" and \"as available.\" We make no warranties, whether express, implied, or statutory, regarding the Services.\n\n7.2. **Limitation of Liability:** To the fullest extent permitted by law, Comms.ID's total aggregate liability to you for any and all claims arising out of or in connection with this Agreement or the use of the Services shall not exceed:\n(a) For the Basic Service (free of charge), the amount of one hundred Australian dollars (AUD $100.00).\n(b) For Subscribed Services, the total fees paid by you to us in the twelve (12) months immediately preceding the event giving rise to the claim.\n\n7.3. **Exclusion of Damages:** In no event will Comms.ID be liable for any lost profits, revenue, or data, or for any indirect, special, consequential, or punitive damages.\n\n## **8. Term and Termination**\n\n8.1. **Term:** This Agreement commences on the date you first use the Services and continues until terminated.\n\n8.2. **Termination:** We may suspend or terminate this Agreement and your access to the Services immediately if you breach any term of this Agreement. You may terminate this Agreement at any time by ceasing all use of the Services and de-registering your client.\n\n8.3. **Survival:** Provisions of this Agreement that by their nature should survive termination will remain in effect, including sections on Confidentiality, Intellectual Property, Limitation of Liability, and Governing Law.\n\n## **9. General**\n\n9.1. **Governing Law:** This Agreement is governed by the laws of **Queensland, Australia**. Both parties agree to submit to the exclusive jurisdiction of the courts of Queensland.\n\n9.2. **Future Services:** We may introduce new services or features (such as configurable AI agents). Your use of such new services may be subject to additional terms and fees, which you must agree to before use.\n\n9.3. **Entire Agreement:** This Agreement constitutes the entire agreement between you and Comms.ID regarding your use of the Services as a Relying Party and supersedes all prior agreements.\n",
